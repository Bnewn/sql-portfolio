## 8 Week SQL Challenge

The [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), created by Danny Ma, features realistic business case studies across different industries. Each case study presents progressively complex analytical challenges that mirror the work professional data analysts encounter daily. Through these scenarios, I have applied advanced SQL techniques to solve problems ranging from customer behavior analysis to financial metric calculations and operational optimizations.
